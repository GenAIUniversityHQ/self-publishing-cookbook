# Book Purpose Finder

Based on Chandler Bolt's Five Whys framework from "Published."

## The Core Truth

"When your purpose is strong enough, the how will work itself out."

A book written only for money rarely gets finished. A book written from deep purpose finds its way through every obstacle.

## The Five Book Purposes

Ask the user which resonates most deeply:

### 1. Passion Project
"You have a story burning inside you that HAS to come out."
- The idea won't leave you alone
- You feel incomplete without sharing it
- Success means the book exists, period

### 2. Money/Business Building
"You want to use a book as a business tool."
- Book as lead generation machine
- Book as authority positioning
- Book as backend product driver
- Success = measurable business outcomes

### 3. Authority/Credibility
"You want to be THE recognized expert in your field."
- Speaking opportunities
- Media features
- Premium positioning
- Success = becoming the go-to name

### 4. Network Building
"You want to connect with people you couldn't reach otherwise."
- Podcast access
- Influencer relationships
- Partnership opportunities
- Success = doors that open

### 5. Story Preservation
"You have a story that needs to be told before it's lost."
- Family history
- Personal journey
- Legacy documentation
- Success = the story lives on

## The Five Whys Exercise

Once primary purpose is identified, go deeper:

**Question 1:** Why do you want to write this book?
[User answers]

**Question 2:** Why is that important to you?
[User answers]

**Question 3:** Why does that matter?
[User answers]

**Question 4:** Why is that significant in your life?
[User answers]

**Question 5:** Why is this worth 90 days of your life?
[User answers]

## End Goal Statement Creation

From the Five Whys answers, help user craft:

**Template:**
"By [specific date 90 days out], I will have published [book title/topic] because [deepest why from Question 5]. This matters because [connection to larger life purpose]. When it's done, I will feel [emotional state] and [specific outcome will happen]."

**Example:**
"By April 30, 2025, I will have published my guide to overcoming anxiety without medication because I watched my brother suffer for years with no help. This matters because thousands of people are struggling the same way with no roadmap. When it's done, I will feel like I've honored his journey and at least 100 people will have a path forward."

## Purpose Statement (Shorter Version)

For daily motivation, create a one-line version:

**Template:**
"I am writing [book] because [deepest why]."

**Example:**
"I am writing this book because my brother deserved better, and so does everyone like him."

## Contract With Myself

Have user write and sign:

```
CONTRACT WITH MYSELF

I, [name], commit to completing my book [title/topic] by [date].

My purpose is: [Purpose Statement]

My end goal is: [End Goal Statement]

I understand that:
- The creative process will be hard before it gets good
- I will want to quit at least once
- My purpose is stronger than my excuses

When I want to quit, I will read this contract and remember why I started.

Signed: _________________
Date: _________________
```

## Red Flags to Address

If user says any of the following, probe deeper:

- "I just think it would be cool" -> Dig for real motivation
- "Everyone says I should" -> Whose dream is this?
- "I want to make money" -> Money is outcome, not purpose
- "I don't know, I just want to" -> There's something deeper, find it

## Output Deliverables

1. Primary Purpose Category (1 of 5)
2. Five Whys Answers documented
3. End Goal Statement (paragraph)
4. Purpose Statement (one line)
5. Contract With Myself (signed)

## Next Step

Once purpose is locked, proceed to limiting-belief-dismantler to clear the psychological blocks standing between user and their published book.
