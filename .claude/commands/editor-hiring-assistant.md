# Editor Hiring Assistant

Based on Chandler Bolt's editor hiring methodology from "Published."

## Core Truth

"You can't edit your own book. You're too close to it. Hiring an editor isn't optional--it's essential."

## The Two Types of Editing

### Content Editing (Developmental Editing)
**What it is:** Big picture feedback on structure, flow, clarity, and effectiveness.

**What they look for:**
- Does the book deliver on its promise?
- Are chapters in the right order?
- Are there gaps in the logic?
- Is the reader journey smooth?
- Do stories land?

**When needed:** First editing pass, before copy editing.

### Copy Editing (Line Editing)
**What it is:** Grammar, spelling, punctuation, and sentence-level polish.

**What they look for:**
- Typos and misspellings
- Grammar errors
- Punctuation issues
- Awkward phrasing
- Consistency (style, formatting)

**When needed:** Final pass, after content is locked.

## Editing Budget

### Industry Rates
- Content editing: $0.01-$0.02/word
- Copy editing: $0.005-$0.015/word
- Combined: $0.015-$0.03/word

### Budget Calculator

| Word Count | Copy Only (Low) | Copy Only (High) | Both (Low) | Both (High) |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|------------|-------------|
| 15,000 | $75 | $225 | $225 | $450 |
| 20,000 | $100 | $300 | $300 | $600 |
| 25,000 | $125 | $375 | $375 | $750 |
| 30,000 | $150 | $450 | $450 | $900 |

**Reality check:** A solid edit for a 22,000-word book: $110-$330.

### The "Purple Cow" Test

Including a specific word they must use (like "purple") filters out mass applicants who didn't read your posting. Reject any application without it.

---

## Vetting Protocol

### Step 1: Initial Filter
- Did they include "purple" (or your keyword)?
- Is their rate within budget?
- Do they have relevant experience?
- Is their English excellent in the proposal?

### Step 2: Sample Edit
"Would you be willing to edit a 500-word sample from my book? I'll pay $[10-25] for this test."

**What to look for in sample:**
- Quality of corrections
- Appropriate level of changes
- Preserved your voice
- Professional track changes
- Turnaround time

### Step 3: Reference Check
For editors with limited reviews, ask:
"Can you share contact info for a previous client I could speak with briefly?"

Before hiring, confirm:

## Red Flags to Watch

- **No samples or portfolio:** Everyone has samples.
- **Way below market rate:** Cheap often means inexperienced.
- **Promises "perfect" results:** Editing is subjective.
- **No questions about your book:** They should be curious.
- **Defensive about feedback:** You need collaborative partners.
- **Missed the keyword test:** Didn't read your posting.

## Output Deliverables

1. **Editing budget** calculated for your word count
2. **Job posting** customized and ready
3. **Vetting criteria** checklist
4. **Sample chapter** selected for test
5. **Timeline** with milestones
