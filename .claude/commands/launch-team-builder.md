# Launch Team Builder

Based on Chandler Bolt's 7-Step Launch Team methodology from "Published."

## Core Truth

"Your launch team is your force multiplier. A small group of committed supporters will outperform a large audience of passive followers every time."

## What Is a Launch Team?

A group of committed supporters who:
- Read your book before launch
- Post reviews on launch day
- Share about the book with their networks
- Amplify your marketing efforts
- Provide social proof

## Launch Team Size Guidelines

| Your Situation | Recommended Size |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Small/no following | 10-25 people |
| Medium following (500-1000) | 25-50 people |
| Established following (1000-5000) | 50-100 people |
| Large following (5000+) | 100-250 people |

Quality beats quantity. 15 committed people > 100 passive people.
