# Limiting Belief Dismantler

Based on Chandler Bolt's 11 Limiting Beliefs framework from "Published."

## Core Truth

"I used to struggle with many of these beliefs. Then I realized they were just stories I was telling myself."

Every successful author had the same doubts. The difference is they moved forward anyway.

## The 11 Limiting Beliefs

### 1. "It's not the right time."

**The Lie:** There will be a better time with more space, energy, or clarity.

**The Truth:** There is never a "right" time. Waiting for perfect conditions is waiting forever.

**Reframe:** "If not now, when? The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."

**Evidence:** Ask user to name one thing they accomplished that happened at the "perfect" time. Almost nothing does.

---

### 2. "I'm afraid of failure."

**The Lie:** If the book fails, you fail as a person.

**The Truth:** The only real failure is not trying. A published book that sells 100 copies is infinitely more successful than an unwritten book.

**Reframe:** "Failure is data, not destiny. Every 'failed' book teaches you how to write the next one better."

**Evidence:** Most successful authors' first books weren't hits. J.K. Rowling was rejected 12 times.

---

### 3. "I'm not enough of an expert."

**The Lie:** You need a PhD or 30 years of experience to write a book.

**The Truth:** You only need to be one step ahead of your reader. Your unique perspective IS the value.

**Reframe:** "Expertise is relative. Someone who lost 50 pounds last year has more relevant advice for someone trying to lose 50 pounds than a doctor who's never been overweight."

**Evidence:** The most relatable books come from people in the trenches, not ivory towers.

---

### 4. "I'm not a writer."

**The Lie:** Writers are born with a gift you don't have.

**The Truth:** Writing is a skill, not a talent. It can be learned.

**Reframe:** "You're not a writer YET. You become a writer by writing, not by being anointed."

**Evidence:** Most bestselling authors didn't consider themselves "writers" before their first book.

---

### 5. "I'm not tech-savvy enough."

**The Lie:** Publishing requires complex technical skills you don't have.

**The Truth:** If you can use Microsoft Word, you can publish a book. Amazon made it simple on purpose.

**Reframe:** "Publishing is easier than setting up a Facebook account. Millions of non-technical people have done it."

**Evidence:** Amazon KDP walks you through every step. Tutorials exist for everything.

---

### 6. "I don't have a good book idea."

**The Lie:** Good ideas strike like lightning, and you haven't been struck.

**The Truth:** Good ideas come from systematic exploration, not divine inspiration.

**Reframe:** "You already have a book idea. It's hiding in your experience, your expertise, or your passion. We just need to find it."

**Evidence:** The next skill (book-idea-validator) will prove this through the free-write exercise.

---

### 7. "Writing a book takes too long."

**The Lie:** Books take years to write.

**The Truth:** A focused first draft can be written in 30 days. The entire process can take 90 days.

**Reframe:** "90 days from now, you could have a published book. Or you could have 90 more days of wishing you had written one."

**Evidence:** Chandler Bolt's students routinely publish in 90 days. The SPS method is engineered for speed.

---

### 8. "My book has to be perfect."

**The Lie:** If it's not perfect, it's not worth publishing.

**The Truth:** Done is better than perfect. Perfection is the enemy of published.

**Reframe:** "Your favorite books have typos. Readers don't want perfect, they want valuable."

**Evidence:** First editions of famous books are full of errors. They still changed lives.

---

### 9. "Writing fast means writing poorly."

**The Lie:** Quality requires endless time and revision.

**The Truth:** Speed and quality are not opposites. Constraints breed creativity.

**Reframe:** "Parkinson's Law: Work expands to fill the time available. Give yourself less time, you'll write more focused content."

**Evidence:** Many classic novels were written in weeks, not years. Momentum produces flow.

---

### 10. "I need a literary agent or publisher."

**The Lie:** Self-publishing is for people who couldn't get "real" deals.

**The Truth:** Self-publishing gives you more control, faster timelines, and often more money.

**Reframe:** "Traditional publishing takes 2-3 years and gives you 10-15% royalties. Self-publishing takes 90 days and gives you 70%."

**Evidence:** Many successful authors have left traditional publishing for self-publishing by choice.

---

### 11. "I don't have enough money to publish."

**The Lie:** Publishing requires thousands of dollars in investment.

**The Truth:** You can publish a professional book for under $500. You can publish for free if you do everything yourself.

**Reframe:** "A cover costs $50-200. Editing costs $110-330 for a 22,000-word book. That's less than most hobbies cost in a month."

**Evidence:** Breakdown:
- Cover design: $50-200 (Fiverr)
- Editing: $0.005-$0.015/word
- ISBN: Free through KDP
- Publishing: Free
- Total: $0-500

## Assessment Protocol

Ask user: "Which of these beliefs feel true to you right now?"

Let them identify their top 3.

Then work through each one using the framework above.

## Transformation Exercise

For each identified belief:

1. **Name it:** "The belief that's holding me back is..."
2. **Examine it:** "Where did this belief come from?"
3. **Challenge it:** "What evidence contradicts this belief?"
4. **Replace it:** "My new belief is..."
5. **Anchor it:** "When this old belief surfaces, I will remind myself that..."

## Output Deliverables

1. List of user's top 3 limiting beliefs
2. Transformation exercise completed for each
3. New belief statements documented
4. Anchor statements for when doubts resurface

## Next Step

Once beliefs are transformed, proceed to book-idea-validator to crystallize the book concept.
