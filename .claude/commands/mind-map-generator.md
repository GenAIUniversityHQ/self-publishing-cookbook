# Mind Map Generator

Based on Chandler Bolt's mind mapping methodology from "Published."

## Core Truth

"Don't organize first. Dump first. Organization kills creativity at the brain dump stage."

Mind mapping is about EXTRACTION, not ORGANIZATION. That comes later.

## The 15-Minute Mind Map Protocol

### Setup Instructions

"This exercise takes exactly 15 minutes. You need:
- Paper (blank, unlined works best)
- Pen or markers (multiple colors optional)
- Timer set for 15 minutes
- Your book idea from the previous exercise

No computer. The spatial freedom of paper unlocks ideas differently than typing."

### Step 1: Center Circle

"Write your main book topic in the center of the page. Circle it. This is your trunk."

Example: If writing about managing remote teams, the center says "Remote Team Leadership"

### Step 2: Primary Branches (2 minutes)

"What are the major themes or categories? Draw lines from the center and write one theme per branch."

For Remote Team Leadership:
- Communication
- Trust Building
- Productivity
- Culture
- Hiring
- Tools

### Step 3: Secondary Branches (10 minutes)

"Now for each primary branch, what subtopics, stories, examples, tips, or ideas belong there? Let it flow. No judgment."

For "Communication" branch:
- Async vs sync
- Video call fatigue
- Slack best practices
- Over-communication principle
- Time zone challenges
- The weekly all-hands
- 1:1 structure
- Written vs verbal
- Cultural differences

### Step 4: Wild Connections (3 minutes)

"Look for connections between branches. Draw dotted lines where ideas link across categories."

Example: "Time zone challenges" connects to "Async vs sync" and "Productivity"

### Rules During Mind Mapping

1. **No filtering.** Write every idea, even dumb ones.
2. **No organizing.** Let chaos happen.
3. **No stopping.** If stuck, write "what else?" and keep going.
4. **No judgment.** Nothing is too obvious or too weird.
5. **Quantity wins.** More branches = more raw material.

## AI-Assisted Mind Map Expansion

After the paper mind map, use this prompt structure to expand:

### Prompt Template

"I'm writing a book about [TOPIC] for [SPECIFIC READER].

Here are the themes and subtopics from my mind map:
[PASTE YOUR BRANCHES]

Help me expand this by:
1. Identifying gaps I might have missed
2. Suggesting stories or examples for each branch
3. Noting which branches could become full chapters
4. Flagging branches that might be too thin for a chapter"

### Response Analysis

Mark each AI suggestion:
- (Yes, adding this)
- ? (Maybe, need to think)
- X (No, doesn't fit)

Don't accept everything. The AI doesn't know your unique perspective.

## Mind Map to Content Inventory

After expansion, create a content inventory:

### Template

| Branch | Subtopics | Stories I Have | Research Needed | Chapter Potential |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| [Branch 1] | [List] | [List] | [List] | High/Med/Low |
| [Branch 2] | [List] | [List] | [List] | High/Med/Low |

### High Chapter Potential Criteria:
- You have 3+ stories/examples
- Strong emotional resonance
- Clear actionable content
- Aligns with reader transformation

### Low Chapter Potential Criteria:
- Thin content
- Requires heavy research
- Peripheral to main promise
- Could be covered in another chapter

## Common Mind Map Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Organizing Too Early
**Symptom:** Clean, hierarchical branches with perfect categories.
**Fix:** Mess it up. Add random associations. Let it sprawl.

### Mistake 2: Filtering Ideas
**Symptom:** Small mind map with "only the good stuff."
**Fix:** Write the ideas you think are stupid. They often lead somewhere.

### Mistake 3: Going Too Abstract
**Symptom:** Branches like "Success Principles" or "Key Concepts."
**Fix:** Get specific. What success principles? Name them.

### Mistake 4: Forgetting Stories
**Symptom:** All concepts, no narrative.
**Fix:** For each branch, ask "What story do I have about this?"

## Output Deliverables

1. **Photo/scan of paper mind map**
2. **Digitized branch list** with all subtopics
3. **AI-expanded mind map** with marked additions
4. **Content inventory table**
5. **List of high-potential chapters** (5-15)

## Next Step

Once mind map is complete and content inventory is done, proceed to book-outline-architect to turn this raw material into a structured outline.
