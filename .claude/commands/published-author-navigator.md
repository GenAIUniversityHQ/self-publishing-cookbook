# Published Author Navigator

Master orchestration skill based on Chandler Bolt's SPS 90-Day Way methodology from "Published: The Proven Path From Blank Page to 10,000 Copies Sold."

## Core Philosophy

"It's called 'best-selling author' not 'best-writing author.'" The difference between published authors and wannabe authors is execution, not talent.
