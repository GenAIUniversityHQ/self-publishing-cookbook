# 30-Day Writing Challenge

Based on Chandler Bolt's SPS writing methodology from "Published."

## Core Truth

"You don't need motivation. You need a system. Motivation fades. Systems produce books."

## The Two Sacred Rules

### Rule 1: Never Edit While Writing

When you write, ONLY write. Do not:
- Fix typos
- Reread previous paragraphs
- Restructure sentences
- Second-guess word choices
- Delete anything

Editing and writing use different brain modes. Switching between them kills momentum.

**The mantra:** "I can fix bad writing. I can't fix a blank page."

### Rule 2: Never Work on Two Books at Once

One book. Full focus. 30 days.

Starting a second book is procrastination disguised as productivity.

---

## Backwards Design Setup

### Step 1: Set Your End Goal

"On [DATE 30 days from now], I will have a complete rough draft of [BOOK TITLE]."

Write this date on your calendar. Tell someone.

### Step 2: Calculate Daily Targets

**Formula:**
Total target words ÷ 30 days = Daily word count

**Examples:**
- 15,000 words ÷ 30 = 500 words/day
- 22,500 words ÷ 30 = 750 words/day
- 30,000 words ÷ 30 = 1,000 words/day

### Step 3: Set Weekly Checkpoints

| Week | Chapters Complete | Words Complete | Cumulative % |
|------|------------------|----------------|--------------|
| 1 | Ch 1-3 | [Target] | 25% |
| 2 | Ch 4-6 | [Target] | 50% |
| 3 | Ch 7-9 | [Target] | 75% |
| 4 | Ch 10+ | [Target] | 100% |

Adjust based on your chapter count.

## The Daily Writing Protocol

### Daily Schedule (60-115 minutes)

**Block 1: Chapter Mind Map (15 minutes)**
Before writing today's chapter, mind map just that chapter.
- What's the main point?
- What stories will I tell?
- What frameworks will I teach?
- How does it connect to previous chapter?

**Block 2: Fine-Tune Outline (10 minutes)**
Review your chapter outline from the book-outline-architect.
- Add any new ideas from the mind map
- Clarify the flow
- Note any gaps to fill

**Block 3: Write (35-90 minutes)**
Now write. Follow the outline. Don't stop.
- Timer on
- Phone in another room
- No internet unless essential
- Write until target words are done

### The Circle of Writing Life

This cycle repeats for EVERY chapter:

```
Mind Map (15 min)
     ↓
Outline Tune (10 min)
     ↓
Write (35-90 min)
     ↓
[Next Day: Repeat for next chapter]
```

## Writing Session Protocol

### Before You Start
1. Review purpose statement (why you're writing this book)
2. Review previous chapter's last paragraph (for continuity)
3. Set timer for your writing block
4. Close all other applications

### While Writing
- Follow your outline
- Tell stories in present tense (more vivid)
- Write like you're explaining to one person
- When stuck, write "AND THEN..." and keep going
- Don't delete, just keep moving forward
- Bracket things to research later: [CHECK THIS STAT]

### After Writing
1. Log word count
2. Note any breakthrough ideas
3. Quick capture of tomorrow's starting point
4. Celebrate (seriously, acknowledge the work)

---

## Accountability System

### Find Your "Accountabilibuddy"

Someone who:
- Wants you to succeed
- Will actually follow up
- Won't let you off the hook
- Ideally, also writing a book

### Weekly Accountability Protocol

**Share with your partner:**
1. Words written this week
2. Chapters completed
3. Biggest win
4. Biggest struggle
5. Commitment for next week

**Frequency:** Same time every week, non-negotiable.

### Accountability Script

"Hey [NAME], checking in for Week [#].

This week I wrote [X] words and finished Chapter [#].

My win: [What went well]
My struggle: [What was hard]

Next week I commit to: [Specific goal]

How did your week go?"

## The Creative Process Reality

Expect this emotional journey:

**Stage 1: "This is awesome!"** (Days 1-3)
You're excited. Words flow. You feel like a genius.

**Stage 2: "This is hard."** (Days 4-10)
The novelty wears off. Writing becomes work.

**Stage 3: "This is terrible."** (Days 11-18)
You hate what you've written. Doubt creeps in.

**Stage 4: "I'm terrible."** (Days 19-23)
You question whether you should be writing at all.

**Stage 5: "This isn't as bad as I thought."** (Days 24-27)
You reread earlier chapters. They're actually decent.

**Stage 6: "This is awesome!"** (Days 28-30)
You see the finish line. Pride returns.

**KNOWING THIS CYCLE EXISTS helps you push through stages 3-4.**

## Troubleshooting

### "I missed a day."

Don't try to double up. Just resume tomorrow.
Missing one day is a hiccup. Missing two is a pattern.
Call your accountability partner.

### "I'm stuck on a chapter."

Skip it. Move to the next chapter.
Come back with fresh eyes later.
Progress is better than perfection.

### "I hate what I'm writing."

This is Stage 3 or 4. It's normal.
Keep writing. You'll edit later.
Your future self will fix it.

### "I don't have time today."

How long does 500 words take? 30 minutes.
Can you wake 30 minutes earlier?
Can you skip 30 minutes of Netflix?
What are you actually choosing over your book?

### "I want to quit."

Read your Contract With Myself.
Call your accountability partner.
Review your purpose statement.
Write for just 10 minutes. Often that breaks the block.
