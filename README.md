# Self-Publishing AI Cookbook

A complete Claude Skills ecosystem for guiding entrepreneurs from blank page to published book in 90 days, based on Chandler Bolt's SPS 90-Day Way methodology from "Published: The Proven Path From Blank Page to 10,000 Copies Sold."

## Philosophy

"It's called 'best-selling author' not 'best-writing author.'" The difference between published authors and wannabe authors is execution, not talent.

This cookbook transforms Claude into an implementation partner at every stage of the self-publishing journey.
