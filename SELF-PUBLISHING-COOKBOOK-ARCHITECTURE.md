## COOKBOOK OVERVIEW

This cookbook contains a complete ecosystem of Claude skills designed to guide entrepreneurs through the entire self-publishing journey in 90 days. The system operates on the "Architect Mindset" principle: 90% system design, 10% execution.

### The Philosophy

Chandler Bolt's core insight: "It's called 'best-selling author' not 'best-writing author.'" The difference between published authors and wannabe authors is execution, not talent. This cookbook transforms AI into your implementation partner at every stage.

---

## PHASE 1 SKILLS: FOUNDATION (Days 1-7)

### Skill 1: book-purpose-finder

**Core Framework:** The Five Whys + Backwards Design

**Purpose Categories:**
1. Passion Project - Selfless sharing, charity fundraising
2. Money/Business Growth - Lead generation (NOT primary motivator)
3. Build Authority - Credibility, heavyweight business card

5. Share Your Story - Biographical, problem-solving, fictional

- "Contract with Myself" document

**Key Questions:**
- What level of success are you aiming to achieve?
- Why did you set that end goal?
- Why is that end goal important to you?

---

### Skill 2: limiting-belief-dismantler

**The 11 Limiting Beliefs to Transform:**

1. "The timing isn't right" → "I start before I'm ready. Better tools appear as I go."
2. "I'm worried it will flop" → "I follow a proven system. The risk is in NOT trying."
3. "I'm not an expert" → "Personal experience outweighs credentials. My story has value."
4. "I'm not a writer" → "I'm a storyteller sharing my message."
5. "I'm not tech-savvy" → "If I can read this, I have the skills needed."
6. "I don't have a book idea" → "4-5 books already exist inside me."
7. "Books take too long" → "I can write in 30 days with 1 hour per day."
8. "It must be perfect" → "Done is better than perfect. I can update after publishing."
9. "Writing fast = low quality" → "Shorter deadlines produce higher focus."
10. "I need an agent/deal" → "Self-publishing gives me control and higher royalties."
11. "I don't have enough money" → "Amazon publishing = $0. Only editor + cover cost money."

**Transformation Process:**
1. Identify the belief holding you back
2. Reverse it into an action pledge
3. Post it where you see it daily

---

### Skill 3: book-idea-validator

**The Free-Write Idea Dump Protocol:**
- Time: 15 minutes
- Tools: Pen and paper (not digital)
- Rule: Keep pen moving, no erasing, no judging

**The Familiar Sources:**
- Your occupation (hard-won wisdom from years on the job)
- A hobby or interest (knowledge already acquired)
- A passion (issues that fire you up)
- A learning experience (trials and tribulations survived)

**The 3-Question Filter (ranked priority):**
1. Which book could you write FASTEST? (most material, flows easily)
2. Which idea most likely results in a FINISHED book? (most passionate)
3. Which idea makes you HAPPIEST? (most fun, personally fulfilling)

**TWO WRITING RULES EVER:**
1. Never edit while writing
2. Never work on two books at once

---

### Skill 4: mind-map-generator

**The 15-Minute Brain Dump:**

**Step 1:** Big idea in center of blank paper, circle it, draw jutting lines
**Step 2:** Related ideas at line ends, keep branching, no filter
**Step 3:** Get messy - arrows, circles, lists, misspellings all OK

**Critical Rules:**
- Use pen and paper (different brain activation)
- NO filtering - get everything out
- This is NOT an outline (organization comes later)
- Tape more paper if needed

**Why This Matters:**
Mind mapping prevents writer's block during actual writing. Front-loading this work makes the writing phase effortless.

---

### Skill 5: book-outline-architect

**The 4-Step Outline Process:**

**Step 1: Find Themes**
- Step back from mind map, look at big picture
- Identify 3-7 common themes (these become sections)

**Step 2: Make Lists**
- Create columns with section names as headers
- Transfer related information from mind map to appropriate columns

**Step 3: Find Chapters**
- Identify leading ideas within each section list
- These subsections become chapters
- Circle, underline, draw arrows to identify them

**Step 4: Create the Outline**
- Move to computer, create document
- Sequence chapters logically
- Add sub-points under each chapter heading
- Elaborate further on sub-points

**Balance Principle:**
Outline = GPS/map, not set in stone. Use as guide but allow flexibility.

---

## PHASE 2 SKILLS: 30-DAY WRITING CHALLENGE (Days 8-37)

### Skill 6: 30-day-writing-challenge

**Backwards Design Approach:**

**Step 1: Determine End Goal**
Complete all chapters in your outline

**Step 2: Break Down the Goal**
Example: 15 chapters ÷ 30 days = 0.5 chapter/day

**Step 3: Set Weekly Checkpoints**
Example: 3.5 chapters per week

**Daily Schedule:**
- Chapter Mind Map: 15 minutes
- Fine-tune Outline: 10 minutes
- Write: 35-90 minutes
- **Total: 60-115 minutes/day**

**Book Length Guidelines:**
- Recommended: 15,000-30,000 words
- Typical: 8-21 chapters
- Range examples: 8,250 words to 77,500 words

**Critical Warning:**
Do NOT create title before manuscript done. Writing to a preconceived title causes filtering and cornering.

---

### Skill 7: chapter-mind-mapper

**Per-Chapter Pre-Writing:**

Before each chapter:
1. Write chapter topic in center of page
2. Draw jutting lines
3. Record all branching ideas for that specific chapter
4. Time limit: 15 minutes maximum
5. Add new discoveries to main outline

**The Circle of Writing Life:**
Mind Map → Outline → Write → Repeat

---

### Skill 8: accountability-system

**The Accountabilibuddy Framework:**

**Step 1:** Find one person who agrees to hold you accountable
- Ideally someone also writing a book
- Must ask specifically about book progress

**Step 2:** Make weekly commitment to talk
- Share wins for the week
- Share struggles honestly
- Don't just share victories

**Step 3:** Make deadline goals public
- Share launch date with everyone
- Post progress on social media
- More people watching = more accountability

**Why This Works:**
"Two very different people born a decade apart" can become lifelong accountability partners through this process. Quality relationship > going alone.

---

## PHASE 3 SKILLS: EDITING AND POLISH (Days 38-60)

### Skill 9: verbal-read-through-guide

**The Self-Edit Protocol:**

Read entire draft aloud to yourself, making changes as you go.

**What You'll Discover:**
- Errors that weren't visible when reading silently
- Holes in arguments and stories
- Flow issues and awkward transitions
- What the reader will actually experience

**The Creative Process Reality:**
1. "This is going to be awesome!"
2. "This is hard."
3. "This is terrible."
4. "I'M terrible."
5. "Hey, not bad."
6. "That was awesome!"

**Critical Rule:**
Stick to deadline. Don't revise forever. Done is better than perfect.

---

### Skill 10: editor-hiring-assistant

**The 3.5-Week Editing Timeline:**

- Day 1-2: Hire editor, get started
- Day 3-10: Editor does first content edit
- Day 11-16: You make content changes
- Day 17-19: Editor does final content edit/beginning copy edit
- Day 20-22: You approve changes, final tweaks
- Day 23-25: Editor does final read-through and copy edit

**Pricing Guide:**
$0.005 to $0.015 per word
Example: 22,000 words = $110 to $220

**Upwork Posting Template (Purple Cow Test):**
```
I'm looking for someone with excellent English and literary skills to edit the content and copy edit my book.

The book has already been through a couple self-editing phases, but this is the final edit before the book will be published on Amazon in a few weeks.

It is a [TYPE] book that talks about [TOPIC].

As far as the editing goes, I'm on a pretty short deadline, so I need someone who can work quickly and focus attention on this project over the next 3 weeks.

I need the content and copy edits completed by [DATE 3 WEEKS OUT].

The book is [X] words, [X] chapters, and [X] pages.

I'm looking for someone with editing experience and with interest in this type of book.

Please be prepared to do a short sample edit (about 3 pages) too.

I'm working on this book with previous bestsellers, so this will be great exposure for you and your work.

Please include the phrase "purple cow" at the top of your bid.
```

**Two Types of Editing:**
1. **Content Editing** - Big picture: holes, flow, sequencing, clarity
2. **Copy Editing** - Nitty-gritty: spelling, grammar, punctuation, word choice

---

### Skill 11: title-creator

**The Talk-It-Out Method:**

1. Call someone who knows nothing about your book
2. Record the conversation (10-20 minutes)
3. Explain:
   - Who the book is for (avatar)
   - What the book is about
   - Biggest takeaways for the reader
   - Why people will want to buy it
4. Notice what you repeat unintentionally
5. That repeated message = your title foundation

**Pain Pills vs Vitamins:**
Easier to sell pain relief than prevention. Title should hit pain points.

**Title vs Subtitle:**
- **Title:** Pique interest, hit pain point
- **Subtitle:** Tell what book is about, sell the message, be specific and BOLD

**The Poop-Your-Pants Test:**
"If your title/subtitle makes you want to poop your pants because it's that bold, you've found a winner."

**Before/After Examples:**
- BEFORE: "Activate Your Dreams, Create Solutions, and Achieve Success"
- AFTER: "3 Simple Steps for Re-Sparking Your Buried Dreams and Building a Plan That Finally Works"

---

### Skill 12: cover-design-brief-builder

**Design Brief Template:**
```
Book Title: [TITLE]
Author's Name: [NAME]

[BOOK TITLE] is a book about [DESCRIPTION].

The goal of the book is to stand out on the Amazon platform as a small thumbnail, as well as a 5.5 x 8.5 book with 72" spine.

The imagery should make the viewer feel that the book (and the author) is the authority on [TOPIC].

The reader should feel that they must have this book if they are [TARGET READER DESCRIPTION]. It's more important that the book "pops off the shelf" or stands out and catches the eye quickly.

The most important part of the design is that it sells, not that it looks pretty or well-designed. I am open to any image or illustration you choose. Here are a few words that come to mind when thinking of my book: [EMOTIONAL WORDS].

I like a bold color palette. I like bold titles that you know right away what the title is and what it is about, not too busy and with simple color schemes. 2-3 colors.

Books with covers I like:
[LIST 5 EXAMPLE COVERS]
```

**The Postage Stamp Test:**
Shrink cover to thumbnail size, line up with competition. Does it pop?

**Platform Options:**
1. Fiverr ($5-$20) - Buy 3 gigs from high-rating designers
2. 99designs (tiered pricing) - 15-30 designers compete
3. Upwork - Freelance with design brief

**Key Rule:**
Author name should be smaller than title (unless already famous).
