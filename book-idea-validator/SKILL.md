# Book Idea Validator

Based on Chandler Bolt's idea validation framework from "Published."

## Core Truth

"You already have at least one book inside you. The problem isn't finding an idea. It's choosing one."

## Phase 1: The Free-Write Idea Dump

### Setup Instructions (Read to User)

"Here's what I want you to do. This takes 15 minutes and must be done with pen and paper, not a computer.

Set a timer for 15 minutes. Write down every possible book idea you have. Don't filter. Don't judge. Don't stop writing.

If you run out of ideas, write 'I don't know what else to write' until the next idea comes.

The rules:
1. Pen and paper only (no screens)
2. Keep your hand moving the entire 15 minutes
3. No editing, crossing out, or judging
4. Quantity over quality
5. Include ideas that seem stupid, obvious, or impossible

Go do this now. Come back when you're done."

### After the Free-Write

Ask user to list their ideas here so we can work through them.

## Phase 2: The Familiar

If the free-write didn't surface strong ideas, explore The Familiar sources:

### Source 1: Your Occupation
"What do you do for work? What knowledge have you accumulated that others would pay to learn?"

Examples:
- A realtor writes about first-time home buying
- A therapist writes about managing anxiety
- A manager writes about leading remote teams

### Source 2: Your Hobby
"What do you do for fun that you know deeply?"

Examples:
- A woodworker writes about building furniture
- A gardener writes about urban farming
- A gamer writes about esports strategy

### Source 3: Your Passion
"What topics do you read about obsessively? What could you talk about for hours?"

Examples:
- Personal finance for young adults
- Sustainable living
- Mindfulness practices

### Source 4: Your Learning Experience
"What hard lesson did you learn that could help others avoid your mistakes?"

Examples:
- Surviving divorce
- Recovering from burnout
- Starting over in a new career at 40

### The Combination Question

"Is there an intersection of any of these areas that creates something unique?"

Example: A financial advisor (occupation) who survived bankruptcy (learning experience) writing about rebuilding credit.

## Phase 3: The 3-Question Filter

Take all ideas from the free-write and The Familiar exploration. For each viable idea, ask:

### Question 1: Which book would be FASTEST to write?

Consider:
- Existing knowledge (no research needed)
- Existing content (blog posts, talks, courses)
- Clear structure already in mind
- Stories you've told many times

Rate each idea: 1 (slow) to 5 (fast)

### Question 2: Which book would you be MOST LIKELY TO FINISH?

Consider:
- Sustained interest over 90 days
- Emotional connection to topic
- Low likelihood of perfectionism paralysis
- Accountability already in place

Rate each idea: 1 (unlikely) to 5 (very likely)

### Question 3: Which book would make you HAPPIEST to complete?

Consider:
- Pride in the finished product
- Impact on readers
- Alignment with life purpose
- Story you want to tell the world

Rate each idea: 1 (meh) to 5 (thrilled)

### Scoring

Add up scores for each idea. Maximum possible: 15 points.

| Score | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| 13-15 | Strong candidate. Move forward. |
| 10-12 | Good potential. Consider refining. |
| 7-9 | Proceed with caution. |
| Below 7 | Save for later. Choose another. |

## Phase 4: The Avatar Clarity Check

Before finalizing, validate the idea has a clear reader:

### Questions to Answer

1. **Who is the ONE person this book is for?**
   (Not "everyone interested in X" but one specific person)

2. **What is their biggest pain point?**
   (What keeps them up at night?)

3. **What transformation does your book promise?**
   (From [current state] to [desired state])

4. **Why would they trust YOU to guide them?**
   (Your credibility, experience, results)

### The Sentence Test

Can you complete this sentence clearly?

"My book helps [specific person] go from [painful current state] to [desirable outcome] by [your unique approach]."

Example:
"My book helps first-time managers go from overwhelmed and second-guessing every decision to confident leaders their teams respect by teaching the 5 conversations framework I developed managing 50 people at Google."

If you can't complete this sentence, the idea needs more refinement.

## Output Deliverables

1. **Free-write idea list** (raw capture)
2. **Top 3-5 ideas** with scores from 3-Question Filter
3. **Winning idea** with highest score
4. **Avatar clarity statement** (the sentence test)
5. **Working book description** (2-3 sentences)

## Red Flags

If user can't choose between ideas:
- Apply time constraint: "If you had to choose in the next 5 minutes, which would it be?"
- Use regret minimization: "In 5 years, which unwritten book would you regret most?"
- Phone a friend: "Ask 3 people who know you which they'd buy"

If user has NO ideas after all exercises:
- Go back to The Familiar and dig deeper
- Ask: "What do people always ask you for advice about?"
- Ask: "What have you overcome that others struggle with?"

## Next Step

Once idea is validated, proceed to mind-map-generator to brain-dump everything you know about this topic.
