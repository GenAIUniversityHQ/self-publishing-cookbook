# Book Outline Architect

Based on Chandler Bolt's 4-Step Outline process from "Published."

## Core Truth

"Your outline is your blueprint. Writers who skip the outline spend twice as long wandering in the dark."

A solid outline makes writing feel like filling in blanks instead of creating from nothing.

## The 4-Step Outline Process

### Step 1: Find Your Themes

Look at your mind map branches and content inventory. Identify 5-10 major themes.

**Questions to surface themes:**
- What are the big buckets everything falls into?
- If you had to teach this topic in 5 main lessons, what would they be?
- What does your reader need to learn FIRST before they can understand the rest?

**Example for Remote Team Leadership:**
1. The Remote Mindset Shift
2. Communication Systems
3. Building Trust at Distance
4. Productivity Frameworks
5. Remote Culture Creation
6. Hiring for Remote

### Step 2: Make Your Lists

For each theme, list everything that belongs there from your mind map.

**Template:**

**Theme: Communication Systems**
- Async vs sync decision framework
- The over-communication principle
- Video call fatigue solutions
- Slack channel architecture
- Time zone protocols
- Written communication standards
- 1:1 meeting structure
- Weekly all-hands format

Do this for ALL themes.

### Step 3: Find Your Chapters

Look at each theme's list. Some themes will become single chapters. Others will split into multiple chapters. Some lists will merge.

**Guidelines:**
- Ideal chapter count: 8-21 chapters
- Ideal chapter length: 1,500-3,000 words
- Each chapter needs ONE clear point
- Each chapter needs at least one story

**Splitting signals:**
- List has 10+ items that don't fit together
- Two distinct subtopics within the theme

**Merging signals:**
- Theme has only 3-4 items
- Content is closely related to another theme

**Example transformation:**
"Communication Systems" (theme) becomes:
- Chapter 4: Async vs Sync: Deciding How to Communicate
- Chapter 5: The Over-Communication Protocol
- Chapter 6: Meetings That Don't Waste Time

### Step 4: Create Your Outline

Arrange chapters in logical order and add subpoints.

**Chapter Outline Template:**

```
Chapter [#]: [Title]

Main Point: [One sentence summary]

Key Takeaways:
1. [Takeaway 1]
2. [Takeaway 2]
3. [Takeaway 3]

Story/Example: [Brief description]

Action Item for Reader: [What they should do after reading]
```

## Chapter Sequencing Logic

### Opening Chapters (1-3)
- Hook the reader
- Establish the problem
- Promise the transformation
- Build credibility
- Preview the journey

### Core Chapters (4-N-3)
- Each chapter = one skill, concept, or step
- Build on previous chapters
- Include stories and examples
- End with clear action items

### Closing Chapters (N-2 to N)
- Synthesize the learning
- Address common obstacles
- Inspire action
- Point to next steps
- End with emotional resonance

---

## The Chapter Formula

Each chapter should follow this structure:

1. **Hook** (100-200 words)
   - Story, question, or bold statement
   - Creates curiosity

2. **Context** (200-400 words)
   - Why this matters
   - What the reader will learn

3. **Core Content** (800-1,500 words)
   - The main teaching
   - Stories and examples
   - Frameworks and tools

4. **Action Steps** (100-300 words)
   - Specific things to do
   - Implementation guidance

5. **Transition** (50-100 words)
   - Bridge to next chapter
   - Maintain momentum

## Outline Validation Checklist

Before moving to writing, confirm:

- [ ] 8-21 chapters total

## Output Deliverables

1. **Theme list** (5-10 themes)
2. **Content allocation** (what goes where)
3. **Chapter list** with working titles
4. **Full chapter outlines** using template
5. **Reading order validation** (logical flow confirmed)

## Word Count Planning

**Target total:** 15,000-30,000 words

**Planning template:**

| Chapter | Title | Target Words |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Introduction | 1,500 |
| 2 | [Title] | 2,000 |
| ... | ... | ... |
| Total | | [Target] |

Divide total by 30 days = daily word count target.

## Next Step

Once outline is complete, proceed to 30-day-writing-challenge to begin the writing sprint with your blueprint in hand.
