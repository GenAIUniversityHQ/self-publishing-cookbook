# Buzz Building Strategist

Based on Chandler Bolt's buzz-building methodology from "Published."

## Core Truth

"Marketing doesn't start at launch. Marketing starts the moment you decide to write. Every milestone is content. Every struggle is a story."

## The Give, Give, Involve, Give, Ask Framework

Before any launch:
1. **Give** - Share valuable content freely
2. **Give** - Share more value
3. **Involve** - Bring audience into the journey
4. **Give** - More value, build anticipation
5. **Ask** - Make your launch request

Ratio matters: 4:1 gives to asks minimum.

## The Involvement Principle

Don't just broadcast. Involve your audience:

**Ask for opinions:**
- Cover votes
- Title preferences
- Chapter topic priorities

**Invite participation:**
- Beta readers
- Launch team
- Pre-order bonuses

**Share the process:**
- Behind-the-scenes
- Real struggles (not just wins)
- What you're learning

Involvement creates ownership. Ownership creates advocates.
