# Review Campaign Manager

Based on Chandler Bolt's "Big Ask" methodology from "Published."

## Core Truth

"Reviews are social proof. Social proof drives sales. The difference between a bestseller and a forgotten book is often just the first 50 reviews."

## Why Reviews Matter

### Amazon's Algorithm
- Books with more reviews rank higher
- Higher ranking = more visibility
- More visibility = more sales
- More sales = more reviews (flywheel)

### Reader Psychology
- 72% of buyers check reviews before purchasing
- Books with <10 reviews look unproven
- 50+ reviews = credibility threshold

### The Goal
**First week: 50+ reviews minimum**

## The 3-Step Review Push

### Step 1: Pre-Launch Outreach (5 Days Before)

**Who:** Your most engaged supporters
- Launch team members who finished early
- Friends who've been following your journey
- Colleagues who expressed interest
- Anyone who asked for early access

**The Ask:**
```
Subject: Early copy of [Book Title] - need your help

Hey [Name],

The book launches in 5 days. I'm reaching out personally to a small group of people I trust.

Would you be willing to read it before launch and post an honest review on Day 1?

I've attached a PDF copy. You don't need to finish the whole thing—just read enough to share your honest thoughts.

Reviews on launch day matter more than any other time. Your review literally impacts whether this book succeeds.

Can I count on you?

[Your name]
```

**Goal:** 10-15 committed reviewers ready for Day 1

### Step 2: Launch Day Ask (Moment Book Goes Live)

**Who:** Entire launch team + email list

**The Ask:**
```
Subject: [Book Title] is LIVE - can you help?

[Name],

It's here. [Book Title] just went live on Amazon.

I need to ask you for something specific:

Please post an honest review today.

→ Amazon link: [DIRECT LINK TO REVIEW PAGE]
→ Takes 3 minutes
→ Even 2-3 sentences helps

Here's why it matters: Amazon's algorithm weighs launch-week reviews heavily. Every review in the first 7 days directly impacts whether this book gets seen by readers who need it.

My goal: 50 reviews this week.
Current count: [X]
Your review gets us one step closer.

Thank you for being part of this.

[Your name]

P.S. Already posted? Reply "done" so I can thank you personally!
```

### Step 3: Follow-Up (Day 1-2 After Launch)

**Who:** Anyone who hasn't posted yet

**The Ask:**
```
Subject: Quick follow-up on [Book Title]

Hey [Name],

Quick follow-up—have you had a chance to post your review yet?

If so: THANK YOU! Just reply "done" and I'll stop bugging you.

If not: Could you take 5 minutes today?

→ Direct link: [LINK]

We're at [X] reviews. Goal is [X].

Your honest review—even a few sentences—makes a real difference.

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

## The Autoresponder Sequence

For anyone who downloads/purchases your book, set up this email sequence:

### Email 1: "Just a Quick Thanks"
**Timing:** Immediately after purchase/download

```
Subject: Thanks for grabbing [Book Title]!

Hey [Name],

Just wanted to say thanks for grabbing [Book Title].

I put [months/years] of [experience/research/heart] into this, and it means a lot that you trusted me with your time.

Quick favor: Once you've had a chance to dig in, I'd love to hear what you think. Just reply to this email with any feedback—good, bad, or somewhere in between.

I read every response personally.

Enjoy the book,
[Your name]

P.S. If you have any questions as you read, hit reply. I'm here.
```

### Email 2: "Thanks for the Feedback!"
**Timing:** 2 days after Email 1

```
Subject: Quick follow-up on [Book Title]

Hey [Name],

Hope you've had a chance to start reading!

If you've had any thoughts—positive or constructive—I'd genuinely love to hear them. Just reply to this email.

And if you're enjoying the book, would you consider copying your feedback into an Amazon review?

→ Here's the direct link: [LINK]

Reviews help other readers find the book, and they help me understand what's working (and what isn't).

No pressure either way. I appreciate you.

[Your name]
```

### Email 3: "This Really Means a Lot..."
**Timing:** 1 week after Email 2

```
Subject: One last thing about [Book Title]

Hey [Name],

This is my last email about reviews, I promise!

Here's where we are:
- [X] people have grabbed the book
- [X] reviews posted so far
- Goal: [X] reviews

If you've finished (or even gotten partway through) and haven't posted a review yet, this is me making one last ask.

→ Amazon review link: [LINK]

Even 2-3 sentences makes a difference. Your honest opinion—whatever it is—helps other readers decide.

For everyone who's already posted: THANK YOU. You've made a real impact on this book's success.

Gratefully,
[Your name]
```

## Review Request Best Practices

### DO:
✓ Use templates (saves time, improves consistency)
✓ Provide direct Amazon link (reduce friction)
✓ Share PDF copy for non-purchasers (removes barrier)
✓ Ask title/cover contributors first (they're invested)
✓ Track who's reviewed (don't ask twice)
✓ Send personal thank-you messages
✓ Set realistic goals based on team size
✓ Explain WHY reviews matter

### DON'T:
✗ Be afraid to ask (this is normal and expected)
✗ Beg repeatedly (max 2-3 asks per person)
✗ Get upset at non-reviewers (people are busy)
✗ Forget to thank reviewers (gratitude matters)
✗ Set unrealistic goals (50 is great, 500 is probably not happening Week 1)
✗ Offer incentives for reviews (violates Amazon TOS)
✗ Ask for only 5-star reviews (ask for "honest" reviews)

## Review Tracking System

### Simple Spreadsheet Template

| Name | Email | Sent PDF | Read Book | Review Posted | Date | Thank You Sent |
|------|-------|----------|-----------|---------------|------|----------------|
| [Name] | [Email] | Y/N | Y/N | Y/N | [Date] | Y/N |

### Daily Check-In During Launch Week

**Morning:**
- Check Amazon for new reviews
- Update tracking spreadsheet
- Identify who needs follow-up

**Afternoon:**
- Send follow-up to non-reviewers
- Thank new reviewers personally
- Share review count update with team

**Evening:**
- Post day's progress on social
- Celebrate publicly (screenshots of reviews)
- Plan next day's outreach

---

## Handling Different Scenarios

### Scenario: Someone Hasn't Read the Book
"That's okay! You can still review based on what you've read so far. Partial reviews are totally valid."

### Scenario: Someone Isn't Sure What to Write
"Just answer these questions in 2-3 sentences:
- What did you learn?
- Who should read this?
- What stood out?"

### Scenario: Someone Wants to Give Critical Feedback
"I genuinely appreciate honest feedback. If you have constructive criticism, please include it in your review. It helps me improve and helps readers know what to expect."

### Scenario: Someone Posted but It's Not Showing
"Amazon sometimes delays posting reviews. If it's been 48+ hours, try reposting. Sometimes reviews from new Amazon accounts get held for verification."
