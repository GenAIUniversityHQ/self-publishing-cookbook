# Title Creator

Based on Chandler Bolt's title methodology from "Published."

## Core Truth

"Your title is not art. Your title is an advertisement. Its only job is to make people want to know more."

**Warning:** DO NOT create your title before the manuscript is done. The book reveals its true title through the writing process.

## The Title's Job

### The Title Should:
- Pique interest
- Hit a pain point OR promise a benefit
- Be memorable
- Work at thumbnail size

### The Subtitle Should:
- Tell what the book is actually about
- Be specific and BOLD
- Include the transformation or promise
- Contain searchable keywords

## Pain Pills vs Vitamins

**Pain pills** = Solve an immediate problem (easier to sell)
**Vitamins** = Improve overall wellbeing (harder to sell)

### Examples:

**Pain Pill Titles:**
- "Debt Free Forever" (pain: debt)
- "The Anxiety Solution" (pain: anxiety)
- "Fire Your Boss" (pain: job you hate)

**Vitamin Titles:**
- "Better Living" (vague improvement)
- "Optimize Your Life" (no specific pain)
- "Personal Growth Journey" (too abstract)

**Your title should be a PAIN PILL.** What specific pain does your book solve?

## The Talk-It-Out Method

### Setup

"Get your phone. Set it to record audio. You're going to talk for 10-20 minutes answering these questions. Don't think too hard—just talk."

### Questions to Answer (Record Your Answers)

1. "What is this book about in one sentence?"

2. "Who is this book for? Describe them specifically."

3. "What pain or problem does this book solve?"

4. "What transformation does the reader experience?"

5. "If someone read this book, what would they be able to do that they couldn't before?"

6. "What's the ONE big idea of this book?"

7. "If you had to describe this book to a friend in 30 seconds, what would you say?"

8. "What would make someone pick this book over others on the same topic?"

9. "Complete this sentence: After reading this book, you will ______."

10. "What's the most surprising or counterintuitive thing in this book?"

### After Recording

Listen back. Write down:
- Phrases that stood out
- Words you repeated
- The clearest explanation you gave
- Any "aha" moments

These become your raw material for titles.

## The Boldness Test

"If your title/subtitle makes you want to poop your pants because it's that bold, you've found a winner."

### Too Safe:
"A Guide to Better Productivity"

### Appropriately Bold:
"The Productivity Revolution: How I 10x'd My Output in 90 Days and You Can Too"

### Questions to Test Boldness:

1. Does this title make a clear promise?
2. Would I be nervous to show this to a room of experts?
3. Does it sound like every other book on the topic?
4. Would someone screenshot this to share with a friend?

If you're comfortable with your title, it's probably too weak.

## Subtitle Formula

### Template:
"[Action/How/What] + [Specific Outcome] + [For Whom/In What Timeframe]"

### Examples:

**Title:** Atomic Habits
**Subtitle:** An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones

**Title:** The E-Myth Revisited
**Subtitle:** Why Most Small Businesses Don't Work and What to Do About It

**Title:** Your Book
**Subtitle:** [What reader will learn/do] + [Specific result] + [For whom]

## Testing Your Title

### Quick Tests

1. **The Text Test:** Text 5 friends: "Which of these book titles would you click on?" Give them 3-5 options.

2. **The Amazon Test:** Search your keywords on Amazon. Is your title distinct from existing books?

3. **The Screenshot Test:** If someone saw this title in a feed, would they share it?

4. **The Explain Test:** Can you remember your full title + subtitle without looking?

### Advanced: Facebook Poll

Post your top 3 title options. Ask audience to vote. The wisdom of crowds is usually right.
